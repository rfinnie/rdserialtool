RDUMTOOL - RDTECH UM24C/UM25C/UM34C BLUETOOTH INTERFACE TOOL


_This script is currently in an early stage and could change
significantly._

The RDTech (RuiDeng) UM24C, UM25C and UM34C are low-cost USB
pass-through power measurement devices, and support a decent number of
collection features, as well as full control via Bluetooth. (The non-C
versions of these devices support the same features as the C versions,
but without Bluetooth control.) This program implements all exposed
commands and data collection available by the device's Bluetooth
interface.


Compatibility

-   UM24C, UM25C and UM34C support is complete and tested.
-   Tested under Python 3.6, but should work with 3.4 or later.
-   Linux: Tested fine with both PyBluez (direct) and pyserial (e.g.
    /dev/rfcomm0 via rfcomm bind).
-   Windows: Tested fine with pyserial (e.g. COM4 as set up
    automatically by Windows). Author could not get PyBluez
    compiled/installed.
-   MacOS: When using pyserial (e.g. /dev/cu.UM24C-Port as set up
    automatically by MacOS), writes to the device would succeed (e.g.
    0xf2 to rotate the screen), but reads from the device never arrive.
    Author could not get PyBluez compiled/installed.


Setup

rdumtool requires Python 3, and PyBluez and/or pyserial modules.
Installation varies by operating system, but on Debian/Ubuntu, these are
available via the python3-pybluez and python3-serial packages.

To install rdumtool:

    $ sudo python3 setup.py install

rdumtool may also be run directly from its source directory without
installation.


Bluetooth setup

Varies by operating system. If the pairing procedure asks for a PIN,
enter "1234" verbatim.

For command-line installation on Linux:

    $ bluetoothctl
    Agent registered
    [bluetooth]# scan on
    Discovery started
    [NEW] Device 00:90:72:56:98:D7 UM24C
    [CHG] Device 00:90:72:56:98:D7 RSSI: -60
    [bluetooth]# pair 00:90:72:56:98:D7
    Attempting to pair with 00:90:72:56:98:D7
    [CHG] Device 00:90:72:56:98:D7 Connected: yes
    Request PIN code
    [UM241m[agent] Enter PIN code: 1234
    [CHG] Device 00:90:72:56:98:D7 UUIDs: 00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
    [CHG] Device 00:90:72:56:98:D7 ServicesResolved: yes
    [CHG] Device 00:90:72:56:98:D7 Paired: yes
    Pairing successful
    [bluetooth]# trust 00:90:72:56:98:D7
    [CHG] Device 00:90:72:56:98:D7 Trusted: yes
    Changing 00:90:72:56:98:D7 trust succeeded
    [bluetooth]# exit
    Agent unregistered

Device MAC address will vary. Again, the PIN for the device is "1234".

If you then want to use rdumtool via pyserial, bind it via rfcomm:

    $ sudo rfcomm bind 0 00:90:72:56:98:D7


Usage

To get device information via PyBluez:

    $ rdumtool --device-type=UM24C --bluetooth-address=00:90:72:56:98:D7

Or via pyserial:

    $ rdumtool --device-type=UM24C --serial-device=/dev/rfcomm0

Without any additional arguments, rdumtool will display all information
available from the device. There are various additional flags to set
parameters in the device such as threshold logging; see rdumtool --help
for details.


Example

    $ rdumtool --device-type=UM24C --bluetooth-address=00:90:72:56:98:D7 --rotate-screen --set-record-threshold=0.20

    $ rdumtool --device-type=UM24C --bluetooth-address=00:90:72:56:98:D7
